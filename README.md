# Sentiment Analysis in Music

## Background
This is an individual research project being completed with advising from university faculty.

## Purpose
This project aims to use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to perform Sentiment Analysis\
on user-chosen songs. The project will also utilize Spotify's API to recommend user's new songs,\
and use an algorithm to choose the best recommendation among a set using song metadata also\
retrieved from Spotify's API.

## Stack
The project is either using or intending to use:
  - Lyricsgenius (https://github.com/johnwmillr/LyricsGenius)
  - Spotify API
  - Sam Lowe's GO Emotions classification Model (https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions)
  - Potential for more to come (language translation feature)

## Goals
This is version two of this project. This version aims to:
  - Improve the recommendation function of the program
  - Allow users to pass in songs in multiple languages
